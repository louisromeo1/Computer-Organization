/* RussWire class
 *
 * Reprements a "wire" in the simulation.  It can only be set once - which
 * represents connecting that wire to some sort of "driver".  It can be read
 * many times (though only after it has been set).
 *
 * (If you attempt to read the value before it is set, it throws
 * IllegalArgumentException.)
 *
 * UPDATED: Added the 'clockTick()' feature, which is used for simulations
 *          which need to support multiple clock cycles.
 *
 * Author: Russell Lewis

	 * created), and then never create anything again later.
