		 * We need to perform NOT twice in this component - since XOR

		 * different NOT objects.
		 *
		 * In a program, this is of course a silly design.  But
		 * remember that we are trying to simulate hardware here - and
		 * each component (such as a NOT gate) can only generate one
		 * result per clock tick.  So if we want to negate two different
		 * signals for the same calculation, we need two differnt gates.
